# hyperleaup
Pronounced "hyper-loop". Create and publish Tableau Hyper files from Apache Spark DataFrames or Spark SQL.

## Why are data extracts are _so slow_?
Tableau Data Extracts can take hours to create and publish to a Tableau Server.
Sometimes this means waiting around most of the day for the data extract to complete.
What a waste of time! In addition, the Tableau Backgrounder (the Tableau Server job scheduler)
becomes a single point of failure as more refresh jobs are scheduled and long running jobs exhaust the serverâ€™s resources.

## How hyperleaup helps
Rather than pulling data from the source over an ODBC connection, `hyperleaup` can write data directly to a Hyper file
and publish final Hyper files to a Tableau Server. Best of all, you can take advantage of all the benefits of 
Apache Spark + Tableau Hyper API:
- perform efficient CDC upserts
- distributed read/write/transformations from multiple sources
- execute SQL directly

`hyperleaup` allows you to create repeatable data extracts that can be scheduled to run on a repeated frequency
or even incorporate it as a final step in an ETL pipeline, e.g. refresh data extract with latest CDC.

## Getting Started
Install latest release from PyPI:  
`pip install hyperleaup`

A list of usage examples is available in the `demo` folder of this repo as a [Databricks Notebook Archive (DBC)](demo/Hyperleaup-Demo.dbc) or [IPython Notebook](demo/Hyperleaup-Demo.ipynb).


## Example usage
The following code snippet creates a Tableau Hyper file from a Spark SQL statement and publishes it as a datasource to a Tableau Server.

```python
from hyperleaup import HyperFile

# Step 1: Create a Hyper File from Spark SQL
query = """
select *
  from transaction_history
 where action_date > '2015-01-01'
"""

hf = HyperFile(name="transaction_history", sql=query, is_dbfs_enabled=True)

# Step 2: Publish Hyper File to a Tableau Server
hf.publish(tableau_server_url,
           username,
           password,
           site_name,
           project_name,
           datasource_name)

# Step 3: Append new data
new_data = """
select *
  from transaction_history
 where action_date > last_publish_date
"""
hf.append(sql=new_data)
```

## Creation Mode
There are several options for how to create the Hyper file that can be set by adding argument `creation_mode` when initializing HyperFile instance. The default is PARQUET.

| Mode | Description | Data Size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARQUET | Saves data to a single Parquet file then copies to Hyper file. | MEDIUM |
| COPY | Saves data to CSV format then copies to Hyper file. | MEDIUM |
| INSERT | Reads data into memory; more forgiving for null values. | SMALL |
| LARGEFILE | Saves data to multiple Parquet files then copies to Hyper file. | LARGE |


Example of setting creation mode:  
`hf = HyperFile(name="transaction_history", sql=query, is_dbfs_enabled=True, creation_mode="PARQUET")`

## Hyper File Options
There is an optional `HyperFileConfig` that can be used to change default behaviors.
  - timestamp_with_timezone:
    - If `True`, use timestamptz datatype with HyperFile. Recommended if using timestamp values with Parquet create mode. (default=False)
  - allow_nulls:
    - If `True`, skip default behavior of replacing null numeric and strings with non-null values. (default=False)
  - convert_decimal_precision:
    - If `True`, automatically convert decimals with precision over 18 down to 18. This has risk of data truncation. (default=False)


### Example using configs
```python
from hyperleaup import HyperFile, HyperFileConfig

hf_config = HyperFileConfig(
              timestamp_with_timezone=True, 
              allow_nulls=False,
              convert_decimal_precision=False)

hf = HyperFile(name="transaction_history", sql=query, is_dbfs_enabled=True)
```
